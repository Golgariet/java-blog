Show LOGIN and REGISTER buttons (when no user is logged in) - WORKS (W/O DBS)

## Login

Login to the blog with account (username + password and existing account) - Does not work. Only half-way done feature.
Show a success message or an error message after login - WORKS Really well!

## Register

Register a new user in the H2 DBS (by username + password + full name) - Does not work correctly, but there is a solution. Only thr page is done.
Show a success message after registration or error message in case of some issues - Works really well.

## Logout

Logout the current user. - Does not work, had no time for the implementation.

(CRUD Operations) - Halfway done. Blueprints easily can be created but the DBS connection issue still exists. There is a solution.
